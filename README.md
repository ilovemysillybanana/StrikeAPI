# Ruby StrikeAPI
STATUS:
This API is no longer actively developed, will accept merge requests. 

This is a wrapper for the strikeapi website.

To get more information about Strike go here:
http://getstrike.net/api/

There are different parameters to get different information.

> 0 is a special parameter

0 will always result in the returning of the first result which is the statistics of the query.
However because the statistics are limited, usually passing in 0 as a paramater will result in being given 0.
Passing in paramaters is optional.

Results are numbered starting from 1.

There is an example class included.
