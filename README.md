There are different parameters to get different information.

> 0 is a special parameter

0 will always result in the returning of an the first result which is the statistics of the query.
However because the statistics are limited, usually passing in 0 as a paramater will result in being given 0.
Passing in paramaters is optional.

There is an example class included.
